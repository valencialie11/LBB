# Password
I took this data about passwords from tidytuesday because I was fascinated by how poorly some people's passwords are (I'm definitely guilty too). I decided to make simple plots and extract insights from the data.
I had so much fun exploring the data, cleaning them up and plotting them into nice and neat plots.
This project kind of inspired me to change my passwords into stronger ones and not reuse them multiple times to better secure my online things!
